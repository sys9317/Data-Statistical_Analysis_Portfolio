# Yosup Shin - Statistic/Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

My name is Yosup, I am a Master of International Development Policy Candidate at Georgetown University (McCourt School), specializing in Impact Evaluation and Quantitative Analysis.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between **raw data** and **actionable policy insights**. I have hands-on experience in managing large-scale **RCTs (Kenya)**, validating firm-level data at the **World Bank**, and applying econometric models to solve development challenges.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

You may see my CV in [pdf](https://github.com/sys9317/Data-Statistical_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Shin_Yosup_CV.pdf)

This is a repository to show my previous works, quantitative analysis, and track my progress in International Development journey.
